### Overview
The app will be a calorie/nutrition tracking app with optional built-in features for users attempting intermittent fasting or weight loss. The main features will enable users to keep track of their daily nutrition intake. Additional features will help users maintain an intermittent fasting routine as well as keep track of weight changes. There any apps which do one of the features mentioned, but to my knowledge there aren't any apps that do all of them in one place.

### Features
• User login: User will be able to login to view and alter their data
• Food search: User can search for a food which app will query API for nutrition information
• Add food: User can manually add data for their food 
• Add food eaten: User can add food to what they've eaten for the day with date/time data included

• Daily nutrition tracker: App will generate summaries of total calories and other nutrients eaten, including a macronutrient view
• Fasting timer: App optionally alert user to fasting/eating periods
